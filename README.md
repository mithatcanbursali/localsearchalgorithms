The goal is to arrange the colors on the n by n checkerboard such that no two adjacent squares have the same color, considering only row-wise and column-wise adjacency (not diagonal).

In my source code, I used matrixes as a visualition. 1 represents blue, 2 represents aqua, 3 represents red, 4 represents orange also i increased the fitness value for both algorithms if the algorithms are far from correct solutions.
